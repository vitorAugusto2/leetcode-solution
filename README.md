# Leetcode solutions
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, covering various topics in data structures and algorithms.

The repository is organized as follows:

```python 
    leetcode-solution
    │
    ├── easy
    │   ├── topics
    │   │   ├── problems
    │   │   │   ├── number_problem.py
    │   │   │   └── README.md
    │
    ├── intermediate
    │   ├── topics
    │   │   ├── problems
    │   │   │   ├── number_problem.py
    │   │   │   └── readme.md
    │
    └── hard
        ├── topics
        │   ├── problems
        │   │   ├── number_problem.py
        │   │   └── readme.md
```

Each difficulty level ("easy", "intermediate", and "hard") has folders organized by specific topics. Within each topic 
folder, you will find Python files (`number_problem.py`) containing the solution code, along with a `README.md` file that 
includes a description of the solution, as well as an analysis of time and space complexity.
